<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p align="center">

<div style="text-align: justify">BangunanKu is an Android-based reporting system embedded with machine learning to connect users with the government in reporting damage in civil infrastructure. The main purpose of this application is to help accelerate the government's efforts to manage the risk of damage to civil infrastructure by utilizing the participation of the general public. The general public uses the features available in this application to participate in making comprehensive civil infrastructure damage reports. BangunanKu can validate and classify the level type of damage in building and asphalt images from images taken by users which are then used as material for making reports with information such as damage level type, date, and location of the building which is sent to the cloud server and received by the government concerned.</div>
